Create library: Use the ar (archive) utility:

    ar rcs libweather.a weatherstats.o

    r - replace (if already in)

    c - create if doesn't exist yet

    s - create index for fast access

    (there are the most popular options)

link program: The linker is able to read ar files and extract object file(s) from it.

    gcc -std=c11 -Wall -fmax-errors=10 -Wextra -o program program.o libweather.a

Still doesn't look quite like the first example of a library use with the -l flag. Here goes:

    gcc -std=c11 -Wall -fmax-errors=10 -Wextra -o program program.o -L. -lweather
